        <h3>Hi! I'm Bas</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a 28-year-old self-taught developer from The Netherlands. Currently working
            fulltime at <WorkingCompanyLink/>, a ticketing solutions provider. Programming started as a hobby
            for me and I managed to create a career out of it. When I have some spare time, I
            really like to try new things that are related to programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides working full time, I also have a few open source projects that can be
            found on <MyWorkPage/>. My most recent project is called <Meteocons/>, a free-to
            use set of animated weather icons.
        </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I started experimenting with code back in 2008. I tweaked a lot to existing projects
            from other people to see what happened when I changed something. Since then I gained
            a lot of experience and developed my own (code) style. In 2013 I won two gold medals
            for programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            For programming I primarily use the tools of JetBrains, such as PhpStorm and IntelliJ
            Idea; those applications are a perfect fit for me. All of my projects are stored on
            their own GitHub repository and I host everything on my own Debian-based server. I also
            have another beefy Debian-based server for private projects and tools.
        </p>
