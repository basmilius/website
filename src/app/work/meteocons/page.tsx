            These hand-crafted icons are designed in Adobe Illustrator and animated to SVG files
            using code and Lottie files using Adobe After Effects. They'll look amazing in your
            own project.
        </p>

        <p>
            The icons are available under a MIT-license, which means that they're free to use and
            you may edit them as you wish. The only requirement is that you should preserve any
            copyright notices in the source files.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                High performant Lottie animations are available for every style. These animations were
                created using the LottieFiles plugin for Adobe After Effects.
            </li>

            <li>
                Every style includes both animated and static SVG files. The animated SVG files cannot
                be used on mobile and desktop apps as far as I know. Use the Lottie animations for that.
            </li>

            <li>
                Monochrome style has various font formats available to use on desktop and on the
                web. These fonts are not animated.
            </li>

            <li>
                Static PNG files in various sizes are available. These files are pre-optimized with
                every publish and are updated with every release.
            </li>

            <li>
                The icons can be used in video projects. Various transparent video files are available
                to use and the After Effects source file is also available.
            </li>
